## Week 4 Day 4 — Sets (uniqueness & membership)

### One-Line Definition
A set stores **unique values with no duplicates**.

---

### Why This Matters
Sets are ideal for:
- removing duplicates
- fast membership checks
- comparisons between groups

They are about **existence**, not order.

---

### Mental Model
A set is a **bag that rejects duplicates**.
Order does not matter.

---

### Key Properties
- Unordered
- Mutable
- Unique elements only

---

### Common Uses
- Deduplication
- Membership testing
- Comparing datasets

---

### Beginner Traps
- Expecting order
- Using sets where indexing is needed
- Forgetting sets remove duplicates automatically

---

### Core Rules
- Sets enforce uniqueness
- Sets are fast for `in` checks
- No indexing in sets
