**Date:** 2026-01-12 (Europe/London)  
**Session:** Phase 1 / Week 1  
**Topic:** Variables (names - values - memory)

## Primary Learning Target:
Understand Python variables as names bound to values in memory, and distinguish assignment from evaluation.

## Primary Project Task:
Build and validate a sandbox notebook for micro-testing variable behavior and predictions.

## Secondary Goal:
Practice predicting code behavior before execution to strengthen mental models.

##  Accomplishments
- Concepts Studied (Reflected in notes/)

- Core Concept: Variables

- Key Insight 1:
A variable is not a box—it is a name (label) that points to a value in memory.

- Key Insight 2:
The = operator means assignment, not “equals”; Python evaluates the right-hand side first, then binds the name on the left.

- Additional understanding gained:

Variables must be assigned before use

Reassignment changes the binding, not the value itself

Errors feel less “mysterious” once execution order is understood

## Tasks Completed (Reflected in sandbox.ipynb)

- Created a structured sandbox notebook session header (goal, questions, predictions)

- Ran multiple micro-test cells using simple assignments (x = 5, y = x + 2)

- Practiced prediction → execution → explanation workflow for each cell

- Documented observations in plain English after execution

## Challenges & Blockers

- Problem Encountered:
Initial tendency to think of = as a mathematical equality instead of assignment.

- Resolution / Lesson Learned:
Always read = as “is assigned to” and trace execution top-to-bottom.

- Next Steps on Blockers:
Reinforce this mental model when moving to expressions, types, and reassignment.

## Time & Metrics

Total Focused Learning Time: ~1.5 hours

Project Code / Testing Time: ~1 hour

Energy Level (1–5): 4

## Rules I learned 

- A variable must be assigned before it can be used; otherwise, a NameError occurs.

- Always read = as “is assigned to”

## Plan for Tomorrow (2025-12-18)

High Priority Task 1:
Extend sandbox to types (int, float, str, bool) and observe how variables bind to different object types.

High Priority Task 2:
Introduce intentional errors (e.g., using undefined variables) and practice reading tracebacks calmly.
