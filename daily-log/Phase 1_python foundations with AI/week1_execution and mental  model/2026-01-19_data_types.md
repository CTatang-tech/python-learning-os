## Session Goals for Today
Understand what Python types are, how Python uses them during execution, and why TypeError happens.
**Focus topics:**
- Python built-in types (int, float, str, bool)
- Type compatibility
- TypeError (what it means and when it occurs)

**What I plan to do:**
- Read the concept note on Types & TypeError
- Write predictions before running each code cell

What type is each variable?
Will this operation succeed or fail?

- Trigger a TypeError on purpose

Example: adding a string to an integer

- Fix the error by changing types

Casting (int(), str(), etc.)
Rewriting the operation

- Explain each outcome in plain English

No jargon
One sentence per result

**Planned Experiments**
- Assign the same value to variables of different types
- Print type(x) before and after changes
- Compare:

"5" + "2"

5 + 2

"5" + 2 ❌

- Convert types and retry the operation

**Succes criteria:**
I can explain what a type is in simple terms
I can predict a TypeError before running code
I can explain why Python refuses certain operations
I can fix a TypeError intentionally, not by guessing
I recorded at least ONE reusable rule, for example:
**Rule learned:** Python does NOT guess how to combine different types — I must make the types compatible.
