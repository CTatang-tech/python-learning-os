## LOOPS ('for' & 'while')

## Session Goals for Today
Understand how Python repeats work, how it enters, runs, and exits loops, and how loop conditions control when code runs again or stops.

Big idea:
Python does not guess — it checks the loop condition every time, runs the body top-to-bottom, then checks again.

**Focus topics:**
- for loop execution (iteration over sequences)
- while loop execution (condition-controlled repetition)
- Loop entry and exit conditions
- Iteration order and loop variables
- Infinite loops and how they happen
- Break and continue (flow interruption)

**What I plan to do:**

1️⃣ Read Concept Note

How Python enters a loop

How many times the loop body runs

Difference between iteration-based vs condition-based repetition

2️⃣ Write Execution Predictions

Predict:

How many times the loop runs

The value of the loop variable on each pass

When the loop stops

3️⃣ Trigger Common Loop Failures

Create an infinite while loop

Forget to update the loop condition

Misunderstand the loop variable scope

4️⃣ Fix the Loop

Add or correct the condition

Reorder or move updates (i += 1)

Use break properly

5️⃣ Explain Each Outcome in Plain English

Why the loop ran that many times

Why it stopped (or didn’t)

What changed when the code was reordered

**Planned Experiments**

Below is a **ready-to-run, paste-into-your `sandbox.ipynb` experiment pack** for **LOOPS (`for` & `while`)** that matches your scope exactly: **predict → run → explain → break → fix → record rules**.

Copy/paste section by section. **DO NOT scroll ahead** before writing predictions.

# Daily Learning Log — Date: 2026-01-21
## LOOPS ('for' & 'while')

### Goal
Understand how Python repeats work, how it enters, runs, and exits loops.

Big idea:
Python does not guess — it checks the loop condition every time, runs the body top-to-bottom, then checks again.

### Predict → Run → Explain
For every cell:
1) Predict output + loop count
2) Run
3) Explain what happened in plain English
```

---

## 1) Mental Model: What Python does every loop

### 1A) `for` loop = “next item, next item… until no items”

```python
print("FOR mental model demo")

items = ["A", "B", "C"]

for item in items:
    print("item is:", item)

print("done")
```

**Before running (write prediction in a Markdown cell):**

* How many times does the body run?
* What is `item` each pass?
* What prints last?

---

### 1B) `while` loop = “check condition → run → check again”

```python
print("WHILE mental model demo")

i = 0
while i < 3:
    print("i is:", i)
    i += 1

print("done")
```

**Predict:**

* Exact printed lines
* When does it stop?
* Final `i` value?

---

## 2) Execution Predictions (loop count + variable values)

### 2A) Iteration order + loop variable tracking

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40]

for n in nums:
    print("n:", n)

print("after loop, n is still:", n)
```

**Predict:**

* What prints?
* What is `n` AFTER the loop finishes?

---

### 2B) `range` = controlled sequence of numbers

```python
for i in range(5):
    print("i:", i)
```

**Predict:**

* How many lines?
* First `i`?
* Last `i`?

---

### 2C) `range(start, stop, step)`

```python
for i in range(2, 10, 3):
    print("i:", i)
```

**Predict the exact sequence.**
(Hint: stop is **not included**.)

---

## 3) Trigger Common Loop Failures (SAFE versions)

### 3A) “Infinite loop” pattern — SAFELY stopped with a guard

```python
# This is the classic infinite-loop bug: the condition never changes.
# We add a guard so your notebook does NOT hang.

i = 0
guard = 0

while i < 3:
    print("i:", i)
    # BUG: i never changes
    guard += 1
    if guard == 5:
        print("GUARD: stopping early to prevent infinite loop")
        break
```

**Predict:**

* Why would this be infinite without the guard?
* How many times does it print `i:`?

---

### 3B) Forgetting to update the condition (another safe demo)

```python
x = 10
guard = 0

while x > 0:
    print("x:", x)
    # BUG: x not updated
    guard += 1
    if guard == 4:
        print("GUARD: stopping early")
        break
```

**Predict:**

* What must change to make it stop naturally?

---

### 3C) Misunderstanding loop variable “scope” (it still exists after)

```python
for k in range(3):
    pass

print("k after loop is:", k)
```

**Predict:** what is `k`?

---

## 4) Fix the Loop (correct condition + correct update)

### 4A) Fix 3A by updating inside the loop

```python
i = 0

while i < 3:
    print("i:", i)
    i += 1

print("stopped because i is now:", i)
```

**Explain:** Why did moving `i += 1` into the loop body matter?

---

### 4B) Fix 3B by updating the variable

```python
x = 10

while x > 0:
    print("x:", x)
    x -= 3

print("stopped because x is now:", x)
```

**Predict:**

* How many iterations?
* Final `x`?

---

## 5) break and continue (flow interruption)

### 5A) `break` stops the loop immediately

```python
for n in [2, 4, 6, 7, 8]:
    print("checking", n)
    if n == 7:
        print("found 7 → BREAK")
        break
    print("still inside loop after check")
print("done")
```

**Predict:**

* Which numbers get “checking” printed?
* Does it ever check 8?

---

### 5B) `continue` skips to the next iteration (skips the rest of body)

```python
for n in range(6):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        print("even → skip body for", n)
        continue
    print("odd → run body for", n)
```

**Predict:** which lines print for 0..5?

---

## 6) Loop entry/exit edge cases

### 6A) `while` might run zero times

```python
i = 5
while i < 3:
    print("this will never print")
print("done")
```

**Explain:** Why did the loop body not run even once?

---

### 6B) Off-by-one trap (common beginner bug)

```python
i = 0
while i <= 3:
    print("i:", i)
    i += 1
```

**Predict:** how many times does it run?
**Explain:** Why is this different from `i < 3`?

---

## 7) Mini “Traceback Drill” (loop-related)

### 7A) NameError from wrong variable name inside loop

```python
for i in range(3):
    print("i is", i)
    print(j)   # j is not defined
```

**After running:** write in plain English:

* What was Python trying to do?
* Which line failed?
* What is the fix?

---

### 7B) TypeError from wrong type in loop update

```python
i = 0
while i < 3:
    print("i:", i)
    i = i + "1"  # mixing int and str
```

**After running:** explain the failure and how to fix it.

# ✅ REQUIRED “Rules I Learned” (Paste at end as Markdown)

```markdown
# ✅ Rules I Learned — Loops (for & while)

1) **FOR loops**: Python takes the **next item** from the iterable and assigns it to the loop variable. When items run out, the loop exits.
2) **WHILE loops**: Python checks the **condition first**. If true → run body top-to-bottom → check again.
3) **Infinite loops happen when the condition never becomes false**, usually because the update is missing or misplaced.
4) **break ends the loop immediately**; **continue skips the rest of the loop body** and goes to the next check/next item.
5) Loop variables like `i` or `k` usually still **exist after the loop**, holding the last value assigned.

**One-line summary:** A loop is Python doing “check → run → update → check again” until there’s nothing left (for) or the condition becomes false (while).
```
