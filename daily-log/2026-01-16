# Daily Learning Log — Day 1:2026-01-16

## Session Goals for Today
understand what Python is used for and how it executes code top-to-bottom.
**Focus topics:**
Python execution model.
**What I plan to do:**
- Read concept note on python execution model
- Write execution predictions before running each cell
- Trigger a NameError by using a variable before definition
- Reorder code to make it work
- Explain each outcome in plain English

**Succes criteria:**
- I can explain how Python moves line by line through code
- I can predict when a NameError will occur before execution
- I can explain why reordering lines fixes errors
- I recorded at least one reusable execution rule

## Accomplishments

### Concepts Studied

**Core concepts:**
- Python execution model (how python executes code)

**key insights:**

---

### tasks completed
- Opened Jupyter Notebook
- 

---

### Snippet of Code & Experiments
print("Hello, Python")
print(2 + 3)

**notes:**
Expected: Python prints results  
Observed: Code executes in order, line by line
Error message:

## Challenges & Blockers
problem encountered and resolution

**problem:**

**resolution/lesson learned**

---

## AI Help Used
- “Explain how Python runs code like I’m 10”
- “Difference between script and notebook”
- Generate 3 execution-order mistakes beginners make
- Create a notebook-specific execution trap


**Key insights:**
- Python executes top-to-bottom
- Notebooks allow reordering, scripts don’t

---

## What I Understand Now
- Python is used for automation, data, APIs, analytics
- Code runs line by line
- Order matters

---

## 🧠 Rules I Learned
- Python executes code in order
- Notebooks can hide execution order bugs
